Macspoof
========

A tool for spoofing the Media Access Control (MAC) address for a given Network Interface Card/Controller (NIC) interface on Mac OS X

Implemented in both Python 3 and C because yay, code!

**TODOs**
* Create a listing of known vendor prefixs so you can spoof to a random address within a vendor's block
